	dct:description "CIMO: Level II data (Meteorological parameters). They may be obtained directly from many kinds of simple instruments, or derived from Level I data. For example, a sensor cannot measure visibility, which is a Level II quantity; instead, sensors measure the extinction coefficient, which is a Level I quantity. NOTE: Data exchanged internationally are Level II or Level III data. CEOS: Geophysical information. Retrieved environmental variables (e.g., ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the same resolution and location as the level 1 source data."@en	.
