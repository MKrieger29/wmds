	dct:description "The depth of flow in the cross-section is measured at verticals with a rod or sounding line. As the depth is measured, observations of velocity are obtained with a current meter at one or more points in the vertical. The measured widths, depths and velocities permit computation of discharge for each segment of the cross-section. The summation of these segment discharges is the total discharge (International Organization for Standardization, 1979: Liquid Flow Measurement in Open Channels: Velocity-area Methods. Second edition, ISO 748, Geneva)."@en	.
