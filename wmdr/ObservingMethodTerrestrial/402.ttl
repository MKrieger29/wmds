	dct:description "The stage-discharge relationship is defined by plotting the measured discharges as the abscissa and the corresponding stage as the ordinate. The stage-discharge relationship can readily be expressed by a mathematical equation derived from the available measurements. This equation can be determined by graphical methods or regression methods. The equation is then used to obtain the discharge value given a stage measurement (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
