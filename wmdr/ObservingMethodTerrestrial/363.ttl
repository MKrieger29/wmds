	dct:description "The measuring element consists of two vertical tubes of the same length, at a distance of 0.5 to 0.7 m from each other. One tube contains a source of gamma-radiation (Caesium-137 with a half-life of 30 years and activity of 10 or 30 mCi), while the other contains a detector (Geiger–Müller counter or scintillation crystal with photo-multiplier). In the process of obtaining a profile, a special motor, synchronous with the detector, moves the radioactive source upwards and downwards in the tube.
