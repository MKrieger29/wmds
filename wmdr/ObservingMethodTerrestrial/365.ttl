	dct:description "The method of gamma radiation snow surveying is based on attenuation by snow of gamma radiation emanating from natural radioactive elements in the ground. The greater the water equivalent of the snow, the more the radiation is attenuated. The aerial survey is an integrated areal estimate of snow cover equivalent. The usual flying height for an aerial gamma survey is 25 to 100 m above the land surface. Measurements consist of the total count for a large energy range and spectral counts for specific energy levels (WMO, Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
