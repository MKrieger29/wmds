	dct:description "An acoustic Doppler instrument measures the velocity of the water using a physical principle called the Doppler shift. This states that if a source of sound is moving relative to the receiver, the frequency of the sound at the receiver is shifted from the transmit frequency. The instrument transmits an acoustic pulse of energy into the water which is reflected off particles suspended in, and moving with, the water and some of it returns to the instrument. The instrument measures the Doppler shift (change in frequency) of the reflected energy and uses this to compute the velocity of the water relative to the instrument. The reflected pulses have a frequency (Doppler) shift proportional to the velocities of the scatterers they are travelling in along the acoustic beam: V = ( F_d / 2 F_0 ) C, where F_d is the Doppler shifted frequency received at the transducer, F_0 is the transducer transmit frequency, C is the sound speed, and V is the scatterer (water) velocity (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
