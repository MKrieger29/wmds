	dct:description "A pH meter is a scientific instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions, indicating its acidity or alkalinity expressed as pH. The pH meter measures the difference in electrical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode. The difference in electrical potential relates to the acidity or pH of the solution (Wikipedia, 2021)"@en	.
