	dct:description "The double-electrode system employs two small adjacent electrodes incorporated into a single unit of 10 to 20 cm in length at the end of the cable. The system also includes a battery and an electrical current meter. Current flows through the system when the electrodes are immersed in water. The cable must have negligible stretch and plastic-coated cables are preferred to rubber sheathed cables. The cable is calibrated with adhesive tape or markers at fixed intervals of 1 or 2 m. The exact depth-to-water level is measured by steel rule to the nearest marker on the cable (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
