	dct:description "Many empirical formulae to obtain estimates of evaporation have been developed (Mutreja, 1986) either on the basis of the energy-budget or mass transfer method. However, most of the equations are based on the simple aerodynamic equation (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
