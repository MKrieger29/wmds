	dct:description "The cross-section is divided into 3 to 10 subsections of about equal discharge. A depth-integrated sample is taken at each vertical in the centroid of each subsection by lowering the sampler from the stream surface to the bed and back at a uniform transit rate. This gives a discharge-weighted sample for each centroid (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
