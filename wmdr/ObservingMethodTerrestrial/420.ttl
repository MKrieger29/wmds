	dct:description "Pressure-difference samplers are designed to produce a pressure drop at the exit of the sampler which is sufficient to overcome energy losses and to ensure an entrance velocity equal to that of the undisturbed stream. A perforated diaphragm within the sampler forces the flow to drop its sediment into the retaining chamber and to leave through the upper exit (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
