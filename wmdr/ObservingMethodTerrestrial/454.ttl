	dct:description "A polarographic sensor is commonly used to determine the dissolved oxygen concentration in a liquid. The dissolved oxygen will be reduced at the surface of a noble metal electrode, the working electrode, acting as a cathode: O₂ + 2 H₂O + 4 e– → 4 OH–. A silver/silver chloride counter electrode, the anode, releases the required electrons: 4 Ag → 4 Ag+ + 4 e–. This electron flow from the anode to the cathode represents the measuring signal which is proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in the measured solution (https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/, 2021)."@en	.
