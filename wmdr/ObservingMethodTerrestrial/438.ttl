	dct:description "A composite sample is obtained by mixing several samples to obtain an average value of water qual- ity over the sampling period. Discrete or continuous sampling can be used and the mixing proportion is calculated on a time or discharge basis. A portion of the composite sample is then analysed. A sequential composite is constituted by continuous, constant sample pumping, or by mixing equal water volumes collected at regular time intervals. (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
