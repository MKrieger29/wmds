	dct:description "The thickness of ice is measured by means of an auger and a ruler at representative sites. To minimize errors caused by spatial variability in ice thickness, measurements should be made at a minimum of three points spaced over a distance of at least 5 m, and the measurements should be averaged. The depth of any snow on top of the ice should also be measured (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
