	dct:description "Various pressure-actuated recording gauges in common use operate on the principle that static pressure at a fixed point in the stream is directly proportional to the head of liquid above the point. This relation is described by the following equation: Water level = (P_static – P_atm ) C, where P_static is the pressure in bar on a fixed spot in the water column, P_atm is the atmospheric pressure in bar on the surface of the water column, and C is a factor of the water’s net weight (C = 10.2 for freshwater at 20°C), which changes with the temperature and salinity of the water (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
