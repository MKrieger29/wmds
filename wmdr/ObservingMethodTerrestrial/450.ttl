	dct:description "Automatic samplers range from elaborate instruments with flexible sampling programmes, which require external power and permanent housing, to simple, portable, self-contained devices, such as a submerged bottle with a rate of filling determined by a slow air bleed. These devices are often programmed to sample over a 24-hour period. Both composite- and individual-sample models are available (WMO Guide to Hydrological Practices, 2008)."@en	.
