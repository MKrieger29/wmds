	dct:description "Area enclosed by the projection of the glacier outline onto the surface of an ellipsoid approximating the surface of the Earth or onto a planar horizontal approximation to that ellipsoid. The glacier area excludes nunataks but includes debris-covered parts of the glacier. The glacier outline separates the glacier from unglacierized terrain and from contiguous glaciers."@en	.
