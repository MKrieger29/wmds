	dct:description "Effective depth (thickness) of a cloud from the viewpoint of radiation propagation. Specifically, OD = exp(-K.Δz), where K is the extinction coefficient [km-1] and Δz the vertical path [km] between the base and the top of the cloud. The WMO Cloud Atlas (https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/optical-thickness.html) defines cloud optical thickness as 'The optical thickness of a cloud is the degree to which the cloud prevents light from passing through it.'"@en	.
