	dct:description "The amount of sky estimated to be covered by a specified cloud type (partial cloud amount), or by all cloud types (total cloud amount). In either case, the estimate is made to the nearest okta (eighth) and is reported on a scale which is essentially one of the nearest eighth, except that figures 0 and 8 on the scale signify a completely clear and cloudy sky, respectively, with consequent adjustment to the adjacent 1 and 7 okta intervals."@en	.
